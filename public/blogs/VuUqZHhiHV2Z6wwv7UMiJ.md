# Hello World 👋

Welcome to my very first blog post!

In this blog, I will be sharing my journey as a software engineer — from building hobby projects to solving real-world problems using code. 🚀

## What to Expect?

- 💻 Programming tutorials
- 🔐 Security and cloud tips
- ⚙️ System design thoughts
- 🧠 CS fundamentals

## Why This Blog?

I wanted a place to document what I'm learning. Writing helps me think clearly and stay accountable. I hope my notes and insights help you too.
